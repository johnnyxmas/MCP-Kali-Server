# MCP Kali Server

**Kali MCP Server** is a lightweight API bridge that connects MCP Clients (e.g: Claude Desktop, [5ire](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire)) to the API server which allows excuting commands on a Linux terminal.

This allows the MCP to run terminal commands like `nmap`, `nxc` or any other tool, interact with web applications using tools like `curl`, `wget`, `gobuster`. 
 And perform **AI-assisted penetration testing**, solving **CTF web challenge** in real time, helping in **solving machines from HTB or THM**.

## üîç Use Case

The goal is to enable AI-driven offensive security testing by:

- Letting the MCP interact with AI endpoints like OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, or any other models.
- Exposing an API to execute commands on a Kali machine.
- Using AI to suggest and run terminal commands to solve CTF challenges or automate recon/exploitation tasks.
- Allowing MCP apps to send custom requests (e.g., `curl`, `nmap`, `ffuf`, etc.) and receive structured outputs.

Here are some example for my testing (I used google's AI `gemini 2.0 flash`)

## üöÄ Features

- üß† **AI Endpoint Integration**: Connect your kali to any MCP of your liking such as claude desktop or 5ier.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Command Execution API**: Exposes a controlled API to execute terminal commands on your Kali Linux machine.
- üï∏Ô∏è **Web Challenge Support**: AI can interact with websites and APIs, capture flags via `curl` and any other tool AI the needs.
- üîê **Designed for Offensive Security Professionals**: Ideal for red teamers, bug bounty hunters, or CTF players automating common tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Running

### On your Kali Machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wh0am123/MCP-Kali-Server.git
cd MCP-Kali-Server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 kali_server.py
```

**Command Line Options:**
- `--ip <address>`: Specify the IP address to bind the server to (default: `127.0.0.1` for localhost only)
  - Use `127.0.0.1` for local connections only (secure, recommended)
  - Use `0.0.0.0` to allow connections from any network interface (very dangerous; use with caution)
  - Use a specific IP address to bind to a particular network interface
- `--port <port>`: Specify the port number (default: `5000`)
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode for verbose logging

**Examples:**
```bash
# Run on localhost only (secure, default)
python3 kali_server.py

# Run on all interfaces (less secure, useful for remote access)
python3 kali_server.py --ip 0.0.0.0

# Run on a specific IP and custom port
python3 kali_server.py --ip 192.168.1.100 --port 8080

# Run with debug mode
python3 kali_server.py --debug
```

### On your MCP client machine (can be local or remote)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wh0am123/MCP-Kali-Server.git
cd MCP-Kali-Server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're running the client and server on the same machine:

```bash
./mcp_server.py --server http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

If separate machines, create an ssh tunnel to your Kali MCP server, then launch the client:

```bash
ssh -L 5000:localhost:5000 user@KALI_IP
./mcp_server.py --server http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

NOTE: If you're openly hosting the Kali MCP server on your network (`kali_server --IP...`), you don't need the SSH tunnel ‚ö†Ô∏è(this is highly discouraged)‚ö†Ô∏è.

```bash
./mcp_server.py --server http://LINUX_IP:5000
```

#### Configuration for claude desktop:
edit (C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json)

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "kali_mcp": {
            "command": "python3",
            "args": [
                "/absolute/path/to/mcp_server.py",
                "--server",
                "http://LINUX_IP:5000/"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

#### Configuration for [5ire](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire) Desktop Application:
- Simply add an MCP with the command `python3 /absolute/path/to/mcp_server.py http://LINUX_IP:5000` and it will automatically generate the needed configuration files.

## üîÆ Other Possibilities

There are more possibilites than described since the AI model can now execute commands on the terminal. Here are some example:

- Memory forensics using Volatility
  - Automating memory analysis tasks such as process enumeration, DLL injection checks, and registry extraction from memory dumps.

- Disk forensics with SleuthKit
  - Automating analysis from disk images, timeline generation, file carving, and hash comparisons.
